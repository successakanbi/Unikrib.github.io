Here students can sign-up as regular users then browse through the available apartments listed by agents to pick their preferred apartment to rent, they can also search for vendors and service providers within their campus enivironments on the platform and order products and services from them. Agents, service providers and vendors can register and advertise their apartments, products and the services they render on the platform. Prices will be negotiated on the platform.

The entire project was written in Python as the primary backend language. HTML and CSS were used to design the beautiful Frontend and Javascript was used to make the web page dynamic. The database was set up using mySQL.
