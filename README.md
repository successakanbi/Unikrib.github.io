# UNIKRIB

This is a platform that sorts all accomodation issues for students. Here students can sign-up into a created account as regular users. Then browse through the available apartments listed by service providers to pick their preferred apartment to rent, or they can sign up as service providers and put up the various kinds of services they render. Prices will be negotiated on the platform.
The entire project was written in Python as the primary backend language. HTML and CSS were used to design the beautiful Frontend and Javascript was used to make the web page dynamic. The database was set up using mySQL.
